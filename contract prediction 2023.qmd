# Introduction

What I wanted to do was predict what contracts this year's free agent class might get based off previous offseasons. Stars generally get star-type money on account of there being a maximum contract; but in tiers below, contracts of comparable players usually come up in discussing contract value.

# Methods/Analysis

## Loading Packages

Let's start by loading required packages.

```{r load_pkgs, results="hide"}
packages=c("tidyverse",
           "tidymodels",
           "janitor", # cleaning variable names
           "glmnet", # multinomial regression
           "ranger", # random forest algorithm wrapper
           "kknn", # nearest neighbors algorithm wrapper
           "kernlab", # svm kernel wrapper
           "vip", # variable importance
           "zoo", # rolling/window operations
           "matrixStats", 
           "RColorBrewer",
           "readxl", #read excel files
           "ggdark", # dark background plots
           "gt") # table creator (replace kableExtra & formattable)
for (pkg in packages){
  if(!require(pkg,character.only = TRUE)){
    install.packages(pkg,repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  }
}
```

## Importing the Data

For the statistical data, I've scraped total and advanced stats from Basketball-Reference and stored them in .csv files. This was actually part of a larger project to scrape complete statistics for teams, players and awards (the Kaggle dataset resides [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats)). To my knowledge, my dataset is unique in that it includes BAA stats and ABA stats, which is not really of use here.

The advanced stats I kept were cumulative (offensive win shares, defensive win shares and value over replacement player). For players who played on multiple teams in one season, I kept their total stats and discarded the team-specific season portions. There was an initial desire to use totals to bake in availability/body fragility, but the shortened seasons would cause the model to declare all players to be fragile and underestimate their contract.

In the first iteration of this project, we scaled games played and games started to a normal distribution due to fluctuations in games played between seasons caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We will convert the games started to a percentage of games played and we will change the games played to a percentage of maximum playable games. This maximum will differ for players who played for multiple teams in one season.

```{r load_stats}
#specify columns because otherwise birth year is read as logical
cols_for_stats=cols(
  .default = col_double(),
  player = col_character(),
  pos = col_character(),
  lg = col_character(),
  tm = col_character()
)

advanced<-read_csv("Data/Advanced.csv",col_types = cols_for_stats) %>%
  select(seas_id:mp,ows:ws,vorp) %>% mutate(ws_per_48=ws/mp*48,.before="vorp")
totals<-read_csv("Data/Player Totals.csv",col_types = cols_for_stats)
#max games per season for players on multiple teams
max_games_tots=totals %>% filter(tm=="TOT") %>% group_by(season,lg,tm) %>%
  summarize(max_games_tot=max(g,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% ungroup()
#max games per season for players on single team
max_games=totals %>% filter(tm !="TOT") %>% group_by(season,lg) %>%
  summarize(max_games_non_tot=max(g,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% ungroup()
#coalesce above two into one column in totals df
totals_enhanced=left_join(totals,max_games_tots) %>% left_join(.,max_games) %>%
  mutate(max_games_playable=coalesce(max_games_tot,max_games_non_tot)) %>% 
  select(-c(max_games_non_tot,max_games_tot))
advanced_and_totals<-left_join(totals_enhanced,advanced) %>%
  #if player played for multiple teams in season, only take total row
  mutate(tm=ifelse(tm=="TOT","1TOT",tm)) %>% 
  group_by(player_id,season) %>% arrange(tm) %>% slice(1) %>% 
  mutate(tm=ifelse(tm=="1TOT","TOT",tm)) %>% 
  arrange(season,player) %>%
  mutate(g_percent=g/max_games_playable,gs_percent=gs/g,.before=g) %>% 
  select(-c(gs,max_games_playable)) %>% 
  #filter since 1997 to match w/play-by-play + faster pre-processing
  filter(season > 1996) %>% ungroup()
```

A comment was raised on an earlier iteration regarding positional scarcity. Teams will overpay for the potential piece that puts them "over the hump", whether that be into playoff contention or the more loftier goal of championship contention. Teams might also panic to acquire a player that is deemed to be the last one in a talent tier above the remaining free agents in the same position.

The play-by-play data (available since the 1997 season) keeps track of the percentage of minutes played a player has played in each traditional position (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward & center). I converted the percentages to raw minutes played at each position, and summed across all teams a player played for in the same season. I felt this method was more accurate than using the "totals" row.

```{r load_pbp}
play_by_play<-read_csv("Data/Player Play By Play.csv") %>% 
  filter(tm!="TOT") %>%
  select(seas_id:player,mp:c_percent)

#replace NA's with zeroes
play_by_play[is.na(play_by_play)] <- 0

pbp_pos_mins=play_by_play %>% 
  #convert percents to minutes played at position
  mutate(across(pg_percent:c_percent,~./100*mp)) %>% 
  rename_with(.fn=~gsub(x = ., pattern = "_percent", replacement = "_mp"),
              .cols=pg_percent:c_percent) %>%
  #sum season minutes across different teams
  group_by(season,player_id) %>% 
  mutate(across(mp:c_mp,sum,.names="{col}_summed")) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% ungroup() %>% select(-c(mp:c_mp))
```

Another concern that I noticed is that top tier players have depressed contract predictions. Due to the smaller number of players on the court and smaller rosters in general, an individual player's importance is heightened compared to other team sports. As such, elite players get paid the most money. To identify elite players, I brought in end-of-season All-Defense and All-NBA Team voting.

There are two All-Defense teams made up of 5 players each, honoring the top defensive players in the league. They have been voted on by media since 2014. Prior to that, NBA head coaches voted on the All-Defensive team recipients, with the caveat that they could not vote for players on their own team. Players get 2 points for a first-team vote, and 1 point for a second-team vote. There are three All-NBA teams made of 5 players each, honoring the top overall players in the league. The All-NBA teams are voted on by media, and were expanded to the current 3-team setup in 1989. Players get 5 points for a first-team vote, 3 points for a second-team vote and 1 point for a third-team vote. To normalize differences in total points received, I calculated a player's vote share by dividing their points received by the maximum points available (essentially if every possible voter gave that player a first-team vote).

The All-NBA voting is also pulled from Basketball-Reference from each season's awards voting section (here's [2023](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2023.html#all_leading_all_nba) for an example). Basketball-Reference very recently added All-Defense voting, so I compiled it myself. Since 2014, the NBA has published all voter ballots and I've scraped those PDF files for a separate [project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-endofseason-voting-ballots-20142020). To get earlier results, I relied on [Patricia Bender's site](https://www.eskimo.com/~pbender/index.html) as well as newspapers.com user [iknowball](https://www.newspapers.com/profile/iknowball?tab=clippings).

I decided to completely revamp the free agency training set. Rather than scrape the Basketball-Reference [free agents tracker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/free_agents.fcgi), I decided to scrape the [Pro Sports Transaction Archive](https://www.prosportstransactions.com). The benefits to this decision were twofold:

-   the Basketball-Reference free agents tracker only goes back to the 2016 offseason. The Pro Sports Transaction Archive allows me to add free agency periods before then.

-   Basketball-Reference would mostly include players that were on team rosters on the final day of the regular season, excluding players who were waived during the season.

I started the new training set from the 2012 offseason, which was the first offseason of the new collective bargaining agreement. I kept the logic fairly similar from the previous training set. Players who signed from overseas and players who retired before the start of the next season were not included as free agents. The former would have no statistical data to pull, and the latter would artificially inflate the number of players who didn't sign a contract. Players whose salary & contract years were set to zero either went overseas, had explicitly non-guaranteed first years in their contracts (training camp deals, two ways, ten days, exhibit 10s), or didn't end up signing a contract before the season started. Option years & partially guaranteed years were included in the calculation of contract years; I looked at it as both player & team intending to see out the contract. The majority of year 1 salaries were gathered using Spotrac. Other minor sources include Basketball-Insiders, Basketball-Reference and Patricia Bender.

A couple of new wrinkles while expanding the training set:

-   some players would sign multiple contracts, either due to failing a physical and voiding a contract, or converting from a non-guaranteed contract to a guaranteed one. I decided to take the first contract signed, as future contracts would have been based on additional information.

-   how to handle restricted free agents whose offers were rescinded or not even offered? I could take the status as of contract signing (which would decrease the amount of RFA data to train on) or I could take the status as of the start of free agency (which could be misleading, as the player might not have gotten the same contract as an RFA). I decided on the former.

```{r load_train}
past_free_agents<-read_csv("Data/Past Free Agents.csv")
```

The next file I used was salary cap history, scraped from RealGM. To somewhat normalize comparisons across years, I converted the first year salary to a percentage of the salary cap.

```{r load_cap_hist}
#subtract one from year to match up with offseason in which contract was signed
salary_cap_hist<-read_csv("Data/Salary Cap History.csv") %>% mutate(season=season-1)
#create variable of first year salary as percentage of cap
#easier to compare across years
past_free_agents<-past_free_agents %>% select(-c(terms,Source)) %>% 
  left_join(.,salary_cap_hist) %>% 
  mutate(first_year_percent_of_cap=yr_1_salary/cap) %>% 
  select(-c(yr_1_salary,cap))
```

Quick question, who do you think has the highest recorded salary cap percentage in the dataset? If you chose one of LeBron James, Kevin Durant or Stephen Curry, you'd probably be surprised to find out that you're incorrect! The highest percentage belongs to Carmelo Anthony, who re-signed with the New York Knicks in 2014 for a first-year salary cap percentage of 35.61%. Due to an exception that ["the maximum salary in the first season of a contract is never less than 105% of the salary in the last year of the player's previous contract"](http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q23), Carmelo was able to surpass the 35% league-wide maximum salary.

The last file loaded is our evaluation set: the 2023 free agent class, retrieved from Spotrac. I had to edit this dataset to match the Basketball-Reference names (mainly adding diacritics to European names). In addition, I filtered out players with options. Players who decline player options and players who have their team options declined with more than 3 years of experience become unrestricted free agents. Players with less than or equal to 3 years of experience and a declined team option become restricted free agents. I'll use this fact to see which players & teams might decline their option.

```{r load_eval}
current_fa<-read_csv("Data/Free Agents 2023.csv")
#separate out options to compare what players options get if declined
current_fa_options<-current_fa %>% filter(str_detect(type,"Player|Club")) %>% 
  select(-c(experience,contract_yrs)) %>% 
  rename(option_type=type,option_amt=first_year_percent_of_cap)
#make player options all declined (UFA's)
#make club options ufa or rfa depending on exp
current_fa<-current_fa %>%
  mutate(type=case_when((type=="Player"|(type=="Club" & experience >= 4))~"UFA",
                        (type=="Club" & experience < 4)~"RFA",
                        TRUE~type)) %>% 
  group_by(player) %>% select(-experience) %>% slice(1) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(first_year_percent_of_cap=NA)
```

In the GitHub repository where this project is located, a file called `free agents.r` has more details on exactly how I scraped the train set, evaluation set and the salary cap history.

## Retrospective on Last Year's Results

Before getting into pre-processing, we'll take a look at last year's results and see how the models performed.

```{r last_years_results_load, echo=FALSE}
non_options=read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitrodatta/contract-prediction-2022/master/Non-Option%20Contracts.csv")
options=read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumitrodatta/contract-prediction-2022/master/Options.csv")
combined_predictions=bind_rows(non_options,options) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  #take out totals
  select(-starts_with("total")) %>%
  select(-c(age,type)) %>% 
  mutate(across(ends_with("cap_percent"),~parse_number(.)/100)) %>%
  mutate(x2021_option=parse_number(x2021_option)) %>%
  #correct names
  mutate(player=case_when(str_detect(player,"Otto")~"Otto Porter Jr.",
                          str_detect(player,'Clax')~"Nic Claxton",
                          str_detect(player,"Danuel")~"Danuel House Jr.",
                          str_detect(player,"Lonnie")~"Lonnie Walker IV",
                          str_detect(player,"Woodard")~"Robert Woodard II",
                          TRUE~player)) %>%
  #join predictions with actual
  left_join(.,past_free_agents %>% filter(season==2022)) %>%
  select(-c(season,option_type,type)) %>% 
  #filter out players who either picked up player option or had team option picked up
  filter(is.na(x2021_option)|!is.na(contract_yrs)) %>%
  select(-x2021_option) %>%
  replace_na(list(contract_yrs=0,first_year_percent_of_cap=0)) %>%
  mutate(contract_yrs=factor(contract_yrs,levels=0:5),
         yrs_y1s2=factor(yrs_y1s2,levels=0:5),
         yrs_s1y2=factor(yrs_s1y2,levels=0:5)) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("cap"),~round(.,digits=4)))
rm(non_options,options)
```

```{r accuracy,echo=FALSE}
y1s2_yr_acc=round(accuracy(combined_predictions,truth=contract_yrs,estimate=yrs_y1s2) %>% pull(.estimate)*100,2)
s1y2_yr_acc=round(accuracy(combined_predictions,truth=contract_yrs,estimate=yrs_s1y2) %>% pull(.estimate)*100,2)
```

The years accuracy of the years-first model was `r y1s2_yr_acc`%, while the years accuracy of the salary-first model was `r s1y2_yr_acc`%. The 2020 models were at 49-51% accuracy, but the 2021 models were at 58-60% accuracy. There's been a decline in accuracy after the initial improvement in 2021. Here's some confusion matrices on how each model handled the prediction of contract years.

```{r years_confusion_matrix,echo=FALSE}
#| layout-ncol: 2
y1_yr_heatmap=combined_predictions %>%
  conf_mat(data=.,truth=contract_yrs,estimate=yrs_y1s2) %>%
  autoplot(type="heatmap") +
  ggtitle("Actual Contract Years vs Predicted Contract Years",
          subtitle="Years-First Model")
ggsave(filename = "Images/Years Predict v Actual, Y1S2 Model.png",plot=y1_yr_heatmap)
s1_yr_heatmap=combined_predictions %>%
  conf_mat(data=.,truth=contract_yrs,estimate=yrs_s1y2) %>%
  autoplot(type="heatmap") +
  ggtitle("Actual Contract Years vs Predicted Contract Years",
          subtitle="Salary-First Model")
ggsave(filename = "Images/Years Predict v Actual, S1Y2 Model.png",plot=s1_yr_heatmap)
y1_yr_heatmap
s1_yr_heatmap
```

The incorrect predictions were pessimistic, in that they skewed toward predicting less years than received as evidenced by the sum of the upper triangle being greater than the lower triangle (models forecasting no contract for players who received a one-year contract, one year for players who got two years, etc).

Here are the worst misses for both models.

```{r last_yr_extreme_yr_misses,echo=FALSE}
#| layout-ncol: 2
yrs_s1y2_misses=combined_predictions %>% 
                        arrange(desc(contract_yrs),desc(yrs_s1y2)) %>%
  mutate(abs_error_y1s2_yrs=abs(as.numeric(contract_yrs)-as.numeric(yrs_y1s2))) %>% 
  slice_max(abs_error_y1s2_yrs,n=5) %>% select(player,yrs_y1s2,contract_yrs)
yrs_y1s2_misses=combined_predictions %>% 
                        arrange(desc(contract_yrs),desc(yrs_y1s2)) %>%
  mutate(abs_error_s1y2_yrs=abs(as.numeric(contract_yrs)-as.numeric(yrs_s1y2))) %>% 
  slice_max(abs_error_s1y2_yrs,n=5) %>% select(player,yrs_s1y2,contract_yrs)
gt(yrs_s1y2_misses)
gt(yrs_y1s2_misses)
```

On June 29, 2022 (one day before NBA free agency opened), Bridges was arrested in Los Angeles for [felony domestic violence](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-29/nba-miles-bridges-reportedly-arrested-in-los-angeles-on-suspicion-of-domestic-violence) and was released on \$130,000 bond. Beal was the main reason I decided to bring in end-of-season team voting shares, because I immediately knew he would be getting more than 2 years in a contract offer. Čančar and Hauser re-signed with the Nuggets and Celtics respectively.

```{r last_yr_results,echo=FALSE}
y1_rmse=rmse(combined_predictions,
             truth=first_year_percent_of_cap,
             estimate=y1s2_cap_percent) %>% 
  pull(.estimate)
s1_rmse=rmse(combined_predictions,
             truth=first_year_percent_of_cap,
             estimate=s1y2_cap_percent) %>%
  pull(.estimate)
```

Let's shift our focus to the salary predictions. First, the residual mean squared error of the years-first model was `r y1_rmse`, while the salary-first model had an RMSE of `r s1_rmse`. However, this includes Miles Bridges not receiving a contract when he was predicted for 23.55% of the salary cap under Y1S2 and 21.92% of the salary cap under S1Y2.

```{r last_yr_results_wo_miles_bridges,echo=FALSE}
y1_rmse_revised=rmse(combined_predictions %>% filter(player != "Miles Bridges"),
             truth=first_year_percent_of_cap,
             estimate=y1s2_cap_percent) %>% 
  pull(.estimate)
s1_rmse_revised=rmse(combined_predictions %>% filter(player != "Miles Bridges"),
             truth=first_year_percent_of_cap,
             estimate=s1y2_cap_percent) %>%
  pull(.estimate)
```

Removing Bridges, the new years-first RMSE is `r y1_rmse_revised`, while the new salary-first RMSE is `r s1_rmse_revised`. Last year's Y1 RMSE was 0.0245718 and S1 RMSE was 0.0248204. Even excluding the outlier of Bridges, the RMSEs are greater.

As we did with the years models, let's look at the most extreme salary misses.

```{r last_yr_extreme_sal_misses,echo=FALSE}
sal_y1s2_misses=combined_predictions %>% 
  filter(player != "Miles Bridges") %>%
  mutate(abs_error_y1s2_salary=abs(first_year_percent_of_cap - y1s2_cap_percent)) %>% 
  slice_max(abs_error_y1s2_salary,n=10) %>%
  select(player,y1s2_cap_percent,first_year_percent_of_cap)
sal_s1y2_misses=combined_predictions %>% 
  filter(player != "Miles Bridges") %>%
  mutate(abs_error_s1y2_salary=abs(first_year_percent_of_cap - s1y2_cap_percent)) %>% 
  slice_max(abs_error_s1y2_salary,n=10) %>%
  select(player,s1y2_cap_percent,first_year_percent_of_cap)
gt(sal_y1s2_misses) %>% fmt_percent(columns=y1s2_cap_percent:first_year_percent_of_cap)
gt(sal_s1y2_misses) %>% fmt_percent(columns=s1y2_cap_percent:first_year_percent_of_cap)
```

Common players missed on both models are Bradley Beal, Anfernee Simons, Deandre Ayton, Montrezl Harrell & Marvin Bagley III. Simons, Ayton & Bagley were all restricted free agents. Simons re-upped with the Trail Blazers after stepping into the scoring void left by CJ McCollum in his trade to the Pelicans in February 2022. Ayton signed an offer sheet with the Pacers that was subsequently matched by the Suns. Bagley was never able to live up to the billing of being the number 2 overall pick in 2019, especially with the 3 picks immediately after him being Luka Doncic (4x First-Team All-NBA, 4x All-Star), Jaren Jackson Jr. (2x First-Team All-Defense, 1x Defensive Player of the Year, 1x All-Star) and Trae Young (1x Third-Team All-NBA, 2x All-Star). He was traded from the Kings to the Pistons in January 2022, and re-signed with the Pistons in the offseason. Harrell signed with Philadelphia to back up eventual 2023 Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid and pursue a championship.

On a more positive note, here's some players on which the models were very close on. We'll restrict our view to contracts that had a first year salary that was greater than 5% of the salary cap, as it's easier to get close to minimum & near-minimum contract amounts.

```{r last_yr_extreme_sal_close,echo=FALSE}
sal_y1s2_close=combined_predictions %>% 
  filter(contract_yrs %in% c(1:5) & 
           yrs_y1s2 %in% c(1:5) & 
           first_year_percent_of_cap > 0.05) %>%

Kyle Anderson is the first instance in the 3 years of predictions of an exact match with the actual salary percent. Players on both top 10s are P.J. Tucker, Delon Wright, Isaiah Hartenstein, Jae'Sean Tate and Cody Martin. Only one of the top 10 closest salary hits exceeds 10% as an actual first year salary percentage.

## Data Exploration and Visualizations

Before we train models, let's see how some of the predictors and some of the targets interact. First, let's see how our targets correlate with each other. I've created a box and whisker plot, as well as added the points themselves in a transparent layer with some random variation to differentiate between points.

```{r targets_corr, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
set.seed(1) #to make jitter reproducible
corr_yrs_sal=round(
    cor(past_free_agents$contract_yrs,
    past_free_agents$first_year_percent_of_cap),4)
yrs_vs_sal=past_free_agents %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(contract_yrs),y=first_year_percent_of_cap)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(alpha=0.1,width=0.2) + 
  labs(x="Contract Years",y="First Year Cap %") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  annotate("text",x=1.25,y=0.3,label=paste0("Correlation Coeff:\n",corr_yrs_sal)) +
  dark_theme_gray()
ggsave(filename = "Images/Contract Years Against First Year Salary.png",plot=yrs_vs_sal,
       width=7.5,height=3.75,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Contract Years Against First Year Salary.png")
```

The correlation coefficient is `r corr_yrs_sal*100`%, which shows that the two targets are strongly and positively correlated. The median value of the first year cap % (middle line in each box) increases with an increase in contract length. The highest increase in first year cap % is between a 4-year and 5-year contract.

Next, let's see if an all-encompassing advanced statistic has a relationship with first year cap percentage. Win Shares represent how much a player has contributed to his team's wins by comparing his output to a marginal player. Higher win shares generally indicate a better player.

```{r ws_vs_salary, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
free_agent_ws=left_join(past_free_agents,
                        advanced_and_totals %>% select(seas_id:birth_year,ws)) %>%
  #multiple free agents with same name in same season
  filter(!(player=="Tony Mitchell" & birth_year==1992 & season==2014)) %>%
  filter(!(player=="Chris Johnson" & birth_year==1985 & season==2013))
corr_ws_sal=round(
    cor(free_agent_ws$contract_yrs,
    free_agent_ws$ws),4)
ws_vs_sal=free_agent_ws %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=first_year_percent_of_cap,y=ws,color=factor(contract_yrs))) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette="RdYlGn") +
  labs(x="First Year Cap %",y="Win Shares",color="Contract Years") +
  annotate("text",x=0.05,y=12.5,
           label=paste0("Correlation Coeff:\n",corr_ws_sal)) +
  dark_theme_gray()
ggsave(filename = "Images/Win Shares Against First Year Salary.png",plot=ws_vs_sal,
       width=7.5,height=3.75,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Win Shares Against First Year Salary.png")
```

With a correlation coefficient of `r corr_ws_sal*100`%, win shares are highly correlated with first year cap percentage. This shouldn't be too groundbreaking: better players get paid more. The player with the highest Win Shares to not get a contract is Miles Bridges in 2022 at 7.2, who we covered earlier. The players with the lowest win shares to get a five-year contract are Bradley Beal & Luguentz Dort in 2022 with 1.4 Win Shares (Beal got a maximum contract at 35% of the salary cap, while Dort received 12.4%).

Finally, let's see how many contracts of each length were given in each offseason.

```{r contracts_by_season, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
contract_summary=past_free_agents %>% 
  group_by(season,contract_yrs) %>% summarize(num_contracts=n()) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% mutate(tot_contracts=sum(num_contracts),
                              percent_of_contracts=num_contracts/tot_contracts) %>% 
  ungroup() 
contract_per_seas=contract_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(season),fill=factor(contract_yrs))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y=percent_of_contracts), 
           position="dodge",stat="identity") +
  labs(x="Season",y="Percent of Contracts Given",fill="Contract Years") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdYlGn") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  dark_theme_gray()
ggsave(filename = "Images/Contract Lengths by Offseason.png",plot=contract_per_seas,
       width=7.5,height=4,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Contract Lengths by Offseason.png")
```

It comes as no surprise that as contract length increases, the percent of contracts of that length given out decreases. 2012, 2014, 2017, 2020 & 2021 all follow this descending pattern. There are some outliers:

-   4-year contracts almost doubling 3-year contracts in the reckless spending offseason of 2016 (the year of the cap spike, when the salary cap jumped from \$70 million to \$94 million)

-   2-year contracts outnumbering 1-year contracts in 2013, 2019 and 2022

```{r contracts_by_years_signed, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
avg_yr_contract_summary=contract_summary %>% 
  group_by(contract_yrs) %>% 
  summarize(avg_percent_of_contracts=mean(percent_of_contracts))
contracts_by_years_signed=avg_yr_contract_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(contract_yrs),y=avg_percent_of_contracts,fill=factor(contract_yrs)))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", show.legend = FALSE)+
  labs(x="Contract Years",y="Avg Percent of Contracts Given") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdYlGn") +
  geom_text(aes(label=scales::percent(avg_percent_of_contracts,accuracy=0.01)),
            position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  dark_theme_gray()
ggsave(filename = "Images/Average Contract Lengths.png",plot=contracts_by_years_signed,
       width=7.5,height=4,units = "in")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Average Contract Lengths.png")
```

Compiling all the seasonal data in the previous graph, we see an average offseason has 50% of free agents not signing a contract. The biggest drop is from 2-year contracts to 3-year contracts.

```{r clean_plots,include=FALSE}
rm(yrs_vs_sal,ws_vs_sal,contract_per_seas,contracts_by_years_signed,
   corr_ws_sal,free_agent_ws,contract_summary,avg_yr_contract_summary)
```

## Pre-Processing

### Pre-Processing Stats & Vote Shares

I used regular season stats, although I do understand that some players get paid on the strength of playoff performance. I started off with contract year stats, because there's anecdotal evidence that players exert more effort in their contract year (*cough cough Hassan Whiteside*). All stats except for the advanced stats (OWS, DWS and VORP) were converted to per game. Percentages were left alone.

In addition to using contract year stats and vote shares, I summed the past two years and the contract year.

Why I settled on 3 years:

-   Players do get paid on past performance, so just using contract year stats was out of the question
-   2 years opens up the possibility of a fluke year
    -   Kawhi would have his nine game 2018 season bring down his averages significantly from his 2019 season with the Raptors: adding another year somewhat lessens this effect
-   On the other hand, it's quite unlikely that teams factor in stats from more than 4 years ago, a lot would have changed
    -   the Celtics didn't pay Blake Griffin to recapture his form of his 2019 All-Star year in Detroit (I would hope)
-   Another reason I settled on 3 years is that I can keep the same model for restricted free agents
    -   my thought is that the rookie year is a bonus: great if you did well, but doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things if you did poorly
    -   rookie extension is more based on how you improved over the course of that initial contract
    -   For example, if Ja Morant had a worse rookie year but had the same level of play that he has achieved in his second and third year (as well as next year), I highly doubt that Memphis would have offered him a significantly less amount of money due to that substandard rookie year

I performed the same processing on the three-year totals, using the three-year game total as the denominator for converting to per game. I had to calculate the three-year percentages, and also re-engineered the win shares per 48 minutes metric.

I removed categories that were linear combinations of one another. For example, total rebounds can be found by simply adding up offensive and defensive rebounds, and points are just the result of 2\*(number of 2 point field goals made) & 3\*(number of 3 point field goals made). I kept age and experience as predictor variables, but removed position because I felt it would ultimately reflect in the stats themselves.

I divided the three-year versions of games played percentage, games started percentage, All-NBA voting share and All-Defense voting share by 3 to rescale the columns back to a 0-1 range. For example, James Harden received a 100% vote share in 3 consecutive seasons from 2017-2019. Rather than showing all_nba_share_last_3\_yrs as 1+1+1=3 in his 2019 row, dividing by 3 gives us the more easily understood 100% of possible points received in the last 3 years.

The final step was to replace missing values in the shooting percentages with zeroes. These NA's were originally due to lack of attempts.

### Pre-Processing Positions

I took a three-year rolling sum of minutes played for consistency with the previous stats pre-processing, and converted the totals back to percents.

With 3-year positional percentages in hand, it was time to assign the actual positions. Some players play one position almost exclusively, while other players are more flexible and alternate between positions. I set the baseline for a player to be considered at a "pure position" at 75%: if the player played at any position more than 75% of the time, they were deemed to be that position.

All other players were bucketed into combo positions based on the maximum of the following sums of two traditional positions:

-   combo guard (point guard/shooting guard)

-   small wing (shooting guard/small forward)

-   big wing (small forward/power forward)

-   big man (power forward/center)

Some players had multiple combo positions listed due to a small amount of minutes played and two players had no positions listed due to playing less than a full minute, so those players were added manually.

```{r pre_process_positions}

  #rolling 3 year sum of minutes played total & position

         big_wing=sf_percent_summed_last_3_yrs+pf_percent_summed_last_3_yrs,

                             pos %in% c("pf","c","big_man")~"big"))
```

### Combining Pre-Processing Dataframes

I joined the positional data and grouped by season and positional group to get the percentage of VORP a player has contributed to their position as a proxy for positional scarcity. While a player may not have had a raw high VORP compared to all offseasons, they could have a significant proportion of their positional group's VORP in that specific offseason and possibly induce a bidding war between teams due to unappetizing other options.

I changed contract years from a numeric column to a factor/category column. This changes its prediction from a regression problem to a classification problem. A 2.5-year contract doesn't make much sense, so it is in our best interest to discretize the years and store them as factors rather than round a regression result.

```{r train_set}
train_set=inner_join(three_year_rolling_stats_and_shares,past_free_agents) %>% 
  #multiple free agents with same name in same season
  filter(!(player=="Tony Mitchell" & seas_id==25056)) %>%
  filter(!(player=="Chris Johnson" & seas_id==23991)) %>%
  left_join(.,all_player_pos) %>% group_by(season,pos_group) %>% 
  mutate(position_vorp=sum(vorp_last_3_yrs)) %>% ungroup() %>%
  mutate(percent_of_pos_vorp=vorp_last_3_yrs/position_vorp) %>%
  mutate(contract_yrs=factor(contract_yrs,levels = 0:5)) %>%
  select(-c(pos,pos_group,position_vorp)) %>%
  mutate(across(-c(seas_id:experience,type:contract_yrs),~round(.,digits=4)))
write_csv(train_set,"Data/Train Set.csv")
```
